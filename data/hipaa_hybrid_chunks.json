It is based on sound current \npractice that protected health information should not be used or disclosed when it is not \nnecessary to satisfy a particular purpose or carry out a function. The minimum necessary \nstandard requires covered entities to evaluate their practices and enhance safeguards as needed to \nlimit unnecessary or inappropriate access to and disclosure of protected health information. The \nPrivacy Rule’s requirements for minimum necessary are designed to be sufficiently flexible to \naccommodate the various circumstances of any covered entity. \nHow the Rule Works \nThe Privacy Rule generally requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to limit the \nuse or disclosure of, and requests for, protected health information to the minimum necessary to \naccomplish the intended purpose. The minimum necessary standard does not apply to the \nfollowing: \nC \nC \nC \nC \nC \nC \nDisclosures to or requests by a health care provider for treatment purposes. \nDisclosures to the individual who is the subject of the information. \nUses or disclosures made pursuant to an individual’s authorization. \nUses or disclosures required for compliance with the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act (HIPAA) Administrative Simplification Rules. \nDisclosures to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) when \ndisclosure of information is required under the Privacy Rule for enforcement \npurposes. \nUses or disclosures that are required by other law. \nThe implementation specifications for this provision require a covered entity to develop \nand implement policies and procedures appropriate for its own organization, reflecting the \nentity’s business practices and workforce. While guidance cannot anticipate every question or \nfactual application of the minimum necessary standard to each specific industry context, where it \n\n OC R H IPAA P rivacy \nDecember 3, 2002 \nRevised April 4, 2003 \nwould be generally helpful we will seek to provide additional clarification on this issue in the \nfuture. In addition, the Department will continue to monitor the workability of the minimum \nnecessary standard and consider proposing revisions, where appropriate, to ensure that the Rule \ndoes not hinder timely access to quality health care. \nUses and Disclosures of, and Requests for, Protected Health Information. For uses of \nprotected health information, the covered entity’s policies and procedures must identify the \npersons or classes of persons within the covered entity who need access to the information to \ncarry out their job duties, the categories or types of protected health information needed, and \nconditions appropriate to such access. For example, hospitals may implement policies that \npermit doctors, nurses, or others involved in treatment to have access to the entire medical \nrecord, as needed. Case-by-case review of each use is not required. Where the entire medical \nrecord is necessary, the covered entity’s policies and procedures must state so explicitly and \ninclude a justification. \nFor routine or recurring requests and disclosures, the policies and procedures may be \nstandard protocols and must limit the protected health information disclosed or requested to that \nwhich is the minimum necessary for that particular type of disclosure or request. Individual \nreview of each disclosure or request is not required. \nFor non-routine disclosures and requests, covered entities must develop reasonable \ncriteria for determining and limiting the disclosure or request to only the minimum amount of \nprotected health information necessary to accomplish the purpose of a non-routine disclosure or \nrequest. Non-routine disclosures and requests must be reviewed on an individual basis in \naccordance with these criteria and limited accordingly. \nOf course, where protected health information is disclosed to, or requested by, health care \nproviders for treatment purposes, the minimum necessary standard does not apply. \nReasonable Reliance. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Rule permits a covered entity \nto rely on the judgment of the party requesting the disclosure as to the minimum amount of \ninformation that is needed. Such reliance must be reasonable under the particular circumstances \nof the request. This reliance is permitted when the request is made by: \nC \nC \nA public official or agency who states that the information requested is the \nminimum necessary for a purpose permitted under 45 CFR 164.512 of the Rule, \nsuch as for public health purposes (45 CFR 164.512(b)). \nAnother covered entity. \n\n OC R H IPAA P rivacy \nDecember 3, 2002 \nRevised April 3, 2003 \nC \nC \nA professional who is a workforce member or business associate of the covered \nentity holding the information and who states that the information requested is the \nminimum necessary for the stated purpose. \nA researcher with appropriate documentation from an Institutional Review Board \n(IRB) or Privacy Board. \nThe Rule does not require such reliance, however, and the covered entity always retains \ndiscretion to make its own minimum necessary determination for disclosures to which the \nstandard applies. \nFrequently Asked Questions \nTo see Privacy Rule FAQs, click the desired link below: \nFAQs on Minimum Necessary \nFAQs on ALL Privacy Rule Topics \n(You can also go to http://answers.hhs.gov/cgi-bin/hhs.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php, then \nselect \"Privacy of Health Information/HIPAA\" from the Category drop down list and \nclick the Search button.)"

Have expert determinations been applied outside of the health field? \nYes. The notion of expert certification is not unique to the health care field. Professional \nscientists and statisticians in various fields routinely determine and accordingly mitigate \nrisk prior to sharing data. The field of statistical disclosure limitation, for instance, has \nbeen developed within government statistical agencies, such as the Bureau of the \nCensus, and applied to protect numerous types of data.5 \n2.2. Who is an “expert?” \nThere is no specific professional degree or certification program for designating who is \nan expert at rendering health information de-identified. Relevant expertise may be \ngained through various routes of education and experience. Experts may be found in the \nstatistical, mathematical, or other scientific domains. From an enforcement perspective, \nOCR would review the relevant professional experience and academic or other training \nof the expert used by the covered entity, as well as actual experience of the expert using \nhealth information de-identification methodologies. \n2.3. What is an acceptable level of identification risk for an expert \ndetermination? \nThere is no explicit numerical level of identification risk that is deemed to universally \nmeet the ―very small‖ level indicated by the method. The ability of a recipient of \ninformation to identify an individual (i.e., subject of the information) is dependent on \nmany factors, which an expert will need to take into account while assessing the risk \n5 Subcommittee on Disclosure Limitation Methodology, Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology. \nReport on statistical disclosure limitation methodology. Statistical Policy Working Paper 22, Office of \nManagement and Budget. May 1994. Revised by the Confidentiality and Data Access Committee. 2005. \nAvailable online: http://www.fcsm.gov/working-papers/wp22.html \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nfrom a data set. This is because the risk of identification that has been determined for \none particular data set in the context of a specific environment may not be appropriate \nfor the same data set in a different environment or a different data set in the same \nenvironment. As a result, an expert will define an acceptable ―very small‖ risk based on \nthe ability of an anticipated recipient to identify an individual. This issue is addressed in \nfurther depth in Section 2.6. \n2.4. How long is an expert determination valid for a given data set? \nThe Privacy Rule does not explicitly require that an expiration date be attached to the \ndetermination that a data set, or the method that generated such a data set, is de-\nidentified information. However, experts have recognized that technology, social \nconditions, and the availability of information changes over time. Consequently, certain \nde-identification practitioners use the approach of time-limited certifications. In this \nsense, the expert will assess the expected change of computational capability, as well \nas access to various data sources, and then determine an appropriate timeframe within \nwhich the health information will be considered reasonably protected from identification \nof an individual. \nInformation that had previously been de-identified may still be adequately de-identified \nwhen the certification limit has been reached. When the certification timeframe reaches \nits conclusion, it does not imply that the data which has already been disseminated is no \nlonger sufficiently protected in accordance with the de-identification standard. Covered \nentities will need to have an expert examine whether future releases of the data to the \nsame recipient (e.g., monthly reporting) should be subject to additional or different de-\nidentification processes consistent with current conditions to reach the very low risk \nrequirement. \n2.5. Can an expert derive multiple solutions from the same data set for a \nrecipient? \nYes. Experts may design multiple solutions, each of which is tailored to the covered \nentity‘s expectations regarding information reasonably available to the anticipated \nrecipient of the data set. In such cases, the expert must take care to ensure that the \ndata sets cannot be combined to compromise the protections set in place through the \nmitigation strategy. (Of course, the expert must also reduce the risk that the data sets \ncould be combined with prior versions of the de-identified dataset or with other publically \navailable datasets to identify an individual.) For instance, an expert may derive one data \nset that contains detailed geocodes and generalized aged values (e.g., 5-year age \nranges) and another data set that contains generalized geocodes (e.g., only the first two \ndigits) and fine-grained age (e.g., days from birth). The expert may certify a covered \nentity to share both data sets after determining that the two data sets could not be \nmerged to individually identify a patient. This certification may be based on a technical \nproof regarding the inability to merge such data sets. Alternatively, the expert also could \nrequire additional safeguards through a data use agreement. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \n2.6. How do experts assess the risk of identification of information? \nNo single universal solution addresses all privacy and identifiability issues. Rather, a \ncombination of technical and policy procedures are often applied to the de-identification \ntask. OCR does not require a particular process for an expert to use to reach a \ndetermination that the risk of identification is very small. However, the Rule does require \nthat the methods and results of the analysis that justify the determination be documented \nand made available to OCR upon request. The following information is meant to provide \ncovered entities with a general understanding of the de-identification process applied by \nan expert. It does not provide sufficient detail in statistical or scientific methods to serve \nas a substitute for working with an expert in de-identification. \nA general workflow for expert determination is depicted in Figure 2. Stakeholder input \nsuggests that the determination of identification risk can be a process that consists of a \nseries of steps. First, the expert will evaluate the extent to which the health information \ncan (or cannot) be identified by the anticipated recipients. Second, the expert often will \nprovide guidance to the covered entity or business associate on which statistical or \nscientific methods can be applied to the health information to mitigate the anticipated \nrisk. The expert will then execute such methods as deemed acceptable by the covered \nentity or business associate data managers, i.e., the officials responsible for the design \nand operations of the covered entity‘s information systems. Finally, the expert will \nevaluate the identifiability of the resulting health information to confirm that the risk is no \nmore than very small when disclosed to the anticipated recipients. Stakeholder input \nsuggests that a process may require several iterations until the expert and data \nmanagers agree upon an acceptable solution. Regardless of the process or methods \nemployed, the information must meet the very small risk specification requirement. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nFigure 2. Process for \nexpert determination of \nde-Identification. \nData managers and administrators working with an expert to consider the risk of \nidentification of a particular set of health information can look to the principles \nsummarized in Table 1 for assistance.6 These principles build on those defined by the \nFederal Committee on Statistical Methodology (which was referenced in the original \npublication of the Privacy Rule).7 The table describes principles for considering the \nidentification risk of health information. The principles should serve as a starting point for \nreasoning and are not meant to serve as a definitive list. In the process, experts are \nadvised to consider how data sources that are available to a recipient of health \ninformation (e.g., computer systems that contain information about patients) could be \nutilized for identification of an individual.8 \nTable 1. Principles used by experts in the determination of the identifiability of health \ninformation. \nPrinciple \nDescription \nExamples \n6 This table was adapted from B. Malin, D. Karp, and R.

Although risk actually is more of a continuum, this rough partition illustrates how context impacts risk. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nReplicability \nPrioritize health information \nfeatures into levels of risk \naccording to the chance it will \nconsistently occur in relation \nto the individual. \nLow: Results of a patient’s blood glucose \nlevel test will vary \nHigh: Demographics of a patient (e.g., birth \ndate) are relatively stable \nData source \nAvailability \nDetermine which external \ndata sources contain the \npatients’ identifiers and the \nreplicable features in the \nhealth information, as well as \nwho is permitted access to \nthe data source. \nDistinguishability \nDetermine the extent to \nwhich the subject’s data can \nbe distinguished in the health \ninformation. \nLow: The results of laboratory reports are \nnot often disclosed with identity beyond \nhealthcare environments. \nHigh: Patient name and demographics are \noften in public data sources, such as vital \nrecords -- birth, death, and marriage \nregistries. \nLow: It has been estimated that the \ncombination of Year of Birth, Gender, and \n3-Digit ZIP Code is unique for \napproximately 0.04% of residents in the \nUnited States9. This means that very few \nresidents could be identified through this \ncombination of data alone. \nHigh: It has been estimated that the \ncombination of a patient’s Date of Birth, \nGender, and 5-Digit ZIP Code is unique for \nover 50% of residents in the United \nStates10,11. This means that over half of \nU.S. residents could be uniquely described \njust with these three data elements. \nAssess Risk \nThe greater the replicability, \navailability, and \ndistinguishability of the health \ninformation, the greater the \nrisk for identification. \nLow: Laboratory values may be very \ndistinguishing, but they are rarely \nindependently replicable and are rarely \ndisclosed in multiple data sources to which \nmany people have access. \n9 See L. Sweeney. Testimony before that National Center for Vital and Health Statistics Workgroup for \nSecondary Uses of Health information. August 23, 2007. \n10 See P. Golle.

Sweeney. K-anonymity: a model for protecting privacy. International Journal of Uncertainty, \nFuzziness, and Knowledge-Based Systems. 2002; 10(5): 557-570. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nHigh: Demographics are highly \ndistinguishing, highly replicable, and are \navailable in public data sources. \nWhen evaluating identification risk, an expert often considers the degree to which a data \nset can be ―linked‖ to a data source that reveals the identity of the corresponding \nindividuals. Linkage is a process that requires the satisfaction of certain conditions. The \nfirst condition is that the de-identified data are unique or ―distinguishing.‖ It should be \nrecognized, however, that the ability to distinguish data is, by itself, insufficient to \ncompromise the corresponding patient‘s privacy. This is because of a second condition, \nwhich is the need for a naming data source, such as a publicly available voter \nregistration database (see Section 2.6). Without such a data source, there is no way to \ndefinitively link the de-identified health information to the corresponding patient. Finally, \nfor the third condition, we need a mechanism to relate the de-identified and identified \ndata sources. Inability to design such a relational mechanism would hamper a third \nparty‘s ability to achieve success to no better than random assignment of de-identified \ndata and named individuals. The lack of a readily available naming data source does not \nimply that data are sufficiently protected from future identification, but it does indicate \nthat it is harder to re-identify an individual, or group of individuals, given the data sources \nat hand. \nExample Scenario \nImagine that a covered entity is considering sharing the information in the table to \nthe left in Figure 3. This table is devoid of explicit identifiers, such as personal \nnames and Social Security Numbers. The information in this table is \ndistinguishing, such that each row is unique on the combination of demographics \n(i.e., Age, ZIP Code, and Gender). Beyond this data, there exists a voter \nregistration data source, which contains personal names, as well as \ndemographics (i.e., Birthdate, ZIP Code, and Gender), which are also \ndistinguishing. Linkage between the records in the tables is possible through the \ndemographics. Notice, however, that the first record in the covered entity‘s table \nis not linked because the patient is not yet old enough to vote. \nFigure 3. Linking two data sources to identity diagnoses. \nThus, an important aspect of identification risk assessment is the route by which health \ninformation can be linked to naming sources or sensitive knowledge can be inferred. A \nhigher risk ―feature‖ is one that is found in many places and is publicly available. These \nare features that could be exploited by anyone who receives the information. For \ninstance, patient demographics could be classified as high-risk features. In contrast, \n\nData Considered for SharingAgeZip CodeGenderDiagnosis1500000MaleDiabetes2100001FemaleInfluenza3610000MaleBroken Arm9110001FemaleAcid RefluxVoter Registration Records(Identified Resource)BirthdateZip CodeGenderName2/2/198900001FemaleAlice Smith3/3/197410000MaleBob Jones4/4/191910001FemaleCharlie Doe \n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nlower risk features are those that do not appear in public records or are less readily \navailable. For instance, clinical features, such as blood pressure, or temporal \ndependencies between events within a hospital (e.g., minutes between dispensation of \npharmaceuticals) may uniquely characterize a patient in a hospital population, but the \ndata sources to which such information could be linked to identify a patient are \naccessible to a much smaller set of people. \nExample Scenario \nAn expert is asked to assess the identifiability of a patient‘s demographics. First, \nthe expert will determine if the demographics are independently replicable. \nFeatures such as birth date and gender are strongly independently replicable—\nthe individual will always have the same birth date -- whereas ZIP code of \nresidence is less so because an individual may relocate. Second, the expert will \ndetermine which data sources that contain the individual‘s identification also \ncontain the demographics in question. In this case, the expert may determine \nthat public records, such as birth, death, and marriage registries, are the most \nlikely data sources to be leveraged for identification. Third, the expert will \ndetermine if the specific information to be disclosed is distinguishable. At this \npoint, the expert may determine that certain combinations of values (e.g., Asian \nmales born in January of 1915 and living in a particular 5-digit ZIP code) are \nunique, whereas others (e.g., white females born in March of 1972 and living in a \ndifferent 5-digit ZIP code) are never unique. Finally, the expert will determine if \nthe data sources that could be used in the identification process are readily \naccessible, which may differ by region. For instance, voter registration registries \nare free in the state of North Carolina, but cost over $15,000 in the state of \nWisconsin. Thus, data shared in the former state may be deemed more risky \nthan data shared in the latter.12 \n2.7. What are the approaches by which an expert assesses the risk that \nhealth information can be identified? \nThe de-identification standard does not mandate a particular method for assessing risk. \nA qualified expert may apply generally accepted statistical or scientific principles to \ncompute the likelihood that a record in a data set is expected to be unique, or linkable to \nonly one person, within the population to which it is being compared. Figure 4 provides a \nvisualization of this concept.13 This figure illustrates a situation in which the records in a \ndata set are not a proper subset of the population for whom identified information is \nknown. This could occur, for instance, if the data set includes patients over one year-old \nbut the population to which it is compared includes data on people over 18 years old \n(e.g., registered voters). \n12 See K. Benitez and B. Malin. Evaluating re-identification risks with respect to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. \nJournal of the American Medical Informatics Association. 2010; 17(2): 169-177. \n13 Figure based on Dan Barth-Jones‘s presentation, ―Statistical de-identification: challenges and solutions‖ \nfrom the Workshop on the HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard, which was held March 8-9, \n2010 in Washington, DC. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nThe computation of population uniques can be achieved in numerous ways, such as \nthrough the approaches outlined in published literature.14,15 For instance, if an expert is \nattempting to assess if the combination of a patient‘s race, age, and geographic region \nof residence is unique, the expert may use population statistics published by the U.S. \nCensus Bureau to assist in this estimation. In instances when population statistics are \nunavailable or unknown, the expert may calculate and rely on the statistics derived from \nthe data set. This is because a record can only be linked between the data set and the \npopulation to which it is being compared if it is unique in both. Thus, by relying on the \nstatistics derived from the data set, the expert will make a conservative estimate \nregarding the uniqueness of records. \nExample Scenario \nImagine a covered entity has a data set in which there is one 25 year old male \nfrom a certain geographic region in the United States. In truth, there are five 25 \nyear old males in the geographic region in question (i.e., the population). \nUnfortunately, there is no readily available data source to inform an expert about \nthe number of 25 year old males in this geographic region. \nBy inspecting the data set, it is clear to the expert that there is at least one 25 \nyear old male in the population, but the expert does not know if there are more. \nSo, without any additional knowledge, the expert assumes there are no more, \nsuch that the record in the data set is unique. Based on this observation, the \nexpert recommends removing this record from the data set. In doing so, the \nexpert has made a conservative decision with respect to the uniqueness of the \nrecord. \nIn the previous example, the expert provided a solution (i.e., removing a record from a \ndataset) to achieve de-identification, but this is one of many possible solutions that an \nexpert could offer. In practice, an expert may provide the covered entity with multiple \nalternative strategies, based on scientific or statistical principles, to mitigate risk. \nFigure 4. \nRelationship \nbetween uniques in \nthe data set and the \nbroader population, \nas well as the \ndegree to which \nlinkage can be \nachieved. \nThe expert may consider different measures of ―risk,‖ depending on the concern of the \norganization looking to disclose information. The expert will attempt to determine which \n14 Supra note 10. \n15 See M. Elliot, C. Skinner, and A. Dale.

However, in certain \ninstances, the expert may not know which particular record to be disclosed will be most \nvulnerable for identification purposes. In this case, the expert may attempt to compute \nrisk from several different perspectives. \n2.8. What are the approaches by which an expert mitigates the risk of \nidentification of an individual in health information? \nThe Privacy Rule does not require a particular approach to mitigate, or reduce to very \nsmall, identification risk. The following provides a survey of potential approaches. An \nexpert may find all or only one appropriate for a particular project, or may use another \nmethod entirely. \nIf an expert determines that the risk of identification is greater than very small, the expert \nmay modify the information to mitigate the identification risk to that level, as required by \nthe de-identification standard. In general, the expert will adjust certain features or values \nin the data to ensure that unique, identifiable elements no longer, or are not expected to, \nexist. Some of the methods described below have been reviewed by the Federal \nCommittee on Statistical Methodology16, which was referenced in the original preamble \nguidance to the Privacy Rule de-identification standard and recently revised. \nSeveral broad classes of methods can be applied to protect data. An overarching \ncommon goal of such approaches is to balance disclosure risk against data utility.17 If \none approach results in very small identity disclosure risk but also a set of data with little \nutility, another approach can be considered. However, data utility does not determine \nwhen the de-identification standard of the Privacy Rule has been met. \nTable 2 illustrates the application of such methods. In this example, we refer to columns \nas ―features‖ about patients (e.g., Age and Gender) and rows as ―records‖ of patients \n(e.g., the first and second rows correspond to records on two different patients). \nTable 2. An example of protected health information. \nAge \n(Years) \n\n\n\n\nGender \nZIP Code \nDiagnosis \nMale \nFemale \nMale \nFemale \n\n\n\n\nDiabetes \nInfluenza \nBroken Arm \nAcid Reflux \n16 Supra note 5. \n17 See G. Duncan, S. Keller-McNulty, and S. Lynne Stokes. Disclosure risk vs. data utility: the R-U \nconfidentiality map as applied to topcoding. Chance. 2004; 3(3): 16-20. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nA first class of identification risk mitigation methods corresponds to suppression \ntechniques. These methods remove or eliminate certain features about the data prior to \ndissemination. Suppression of an entire feature may be performed if a substantial \nquantity of records is considered as too risky (e.g., removal of the ZIP Code feature). \nSuppression may also be performed on individual records, deleting records entirely if \nthey are deemed too risky to share. This can occur when a record is clearly very \ndistinguishing (e.g., the only individual within a county that makes over $500,000 per \nyear). Alternatively, suppression of specific values within a record may be performed, \nsuch as when a particular value is deemed too risky (e.g., ―President of the local \nuniversity‖, or ages or ZIP codes that may be unique). Table 3 illustrates this last type of \nsuppression by showing how specific values of features in Table 2 might be suppressed \n(i.e., black shaded cells). \nTable 3. A version of Table 2 with suppressed patient values. \nAge (Years) \nGender \nZIP Code \nDiagnosis \n\n\n\n\nMale \nFemale \nMale \nFemale \nDiabetes \nInfluenza \nBroken Arm \nAcid Reflux \nA second class of methods that can be applied for risk mitigation are based on \ngeneralization (sometimes referred to as abbreviation) of the information. These \nmethods transform data into more abstract representations. For instance, a five-digit \nZIP Code may be generalized to a four-digit ZIP Code, which in turn may be generalized \nto a three-digit ZIP Code, and onward so as to disclose data with lesser degrees of \ngranularity. Similarly, the age of a patient may be generalized from one- to five-year age \ngroups. Table 4 illustrates how generalization (i.e., gray shaded cells) might be applied \nto the information in Table 2. \nTable 4. A version of Table 2 with generalized patient values. \nAge (Years) \nGender \nZIP Code \nDiagnosis \nUnder 21 \nMale \n0000* \nDiabetes \nBetween 21 and 34 \nFemale \n0000* \nInfluenza \nBetween 35 and 44 \nMale \n1000* \nBroken Arm \n45 and over \nFemale \n1000* \nAcid Reflux \nA third class of methods that can be applied for risk mitigation corresponds to \nperturbation. In this case, specific values are replaced with equally specific, but \ndifferent, values. For instance, a patient‘s age may be reported as a random value \nwithin a 5-year window of the actual age. Table 5 illustrates how perturbation (i.e., gray \nshaded cells) might be applied to Table 2. Notice that every age is within +/- 2 years of \nthe original age. Similarly, the final digit in each ZIP Code is within +/- 3 of the original \nZIP Code. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nTable 5. A version of Table 2 with randomized patient values. \nAge (Years) \nGender \nZIP Code \n\n\n\n\nMale \nFemale \nMale \nFemale \n\n\n\n\nDiagnosis \nDiabetes \nInfluenza \nBroken Arm \nAcid Reflux \nIn practice, perturbation is performed to maintain statistical properties about the original \ndata, such as mean or variance. \nThe application of a method from one class does not necessarily preclude the \napplication of a method from another class. For instance, it is common to apply \ngeneralization and suppression to the same data set. \nUsing such methods, the expert will prove that the likelihood an undesirable event (e.g., \nfuture identification of an individual) will occur is very small. For instance, one example \nof a data protection model that has been applied to health information is the k-anonymity \nprinciple.18,19 In this model, ―k‖ refers to the number of people to which each disclosed \nrecord must correspond. In practice, this correspondence is assessed using the \nfeatures that could be reasonably applied by a recipient to identify a patient. Table 6 \nillustrates an application of generalization and suppression methods to achieve 2-\nanonymity with respect to the Age, Gender, and ZIP Code columns in Table 2. The first \ntwo rows (i.e., shaded light gray) and last two rows (i.e., shaded dark gray) correspond \nto patient records with the same combination of generalized and suppressed values for \nAge, Gender, and ZIP Code. Notice that Gender has been suppressed completely (i.e., \nblack shaded cell). \nTable 6, as well as a value of k equal to 2, is meant to serve as a simple example for \nillustrative purposes only. Various state and federal agencies define policies regarding \nsmall cell counts (i.e., the number of people corresponding to the same combination of \nfeatures) when sharing tabular, or summary, data.20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 However, OCR does \n18 Supra note 11. \n19 See K.

Each method has benefits and drawbacks with respect to expected applications of \nthe health information, which will be distinct for each covered entity and each intended \nrecipient. The determination of which method is most appropriate for the information will \nbe assessed by the expert on a case-by-case basis and will be guided by input of the \ncovered entity. \nFinally, as noted in the preamble to the Privacy Rule, the expert may also consider the \ntechnique of limiting distribution of records through a data use agreement or restricted \naccess agreement in which the recipient agrees to limits on who can use or receive the \ndata, or agrees not to attempt identification of the subjects. Of course, the specific \ndetails of such an agreement are left to the discretion of the expert and covered entity. \n2.9.

When can ZIP codes be included in de-identified information? \nCovered entities may include the first three digits of the ZIP code if, according to the \ncurrent publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit \nformed by combining all ZIP codes with the same three initial digits contains more than \n20,000 people; or (2) the initial three digits of a ZIP code for all such geographic units \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \ncontaining 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000. This means that the initial three \ndigits of ZIP codes may be included in de-identified information except when the ZIP \ncodes contain the initial three digits listed in the Table below. In those cases, the first \nthree digits must be listed as 000. \nOCR published a final rule on August 14, 2002, that modified certain standards in the \nPrivacy Rule. The preamble to this final rule identified the initial three digits of ZIP \ncodes, or ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs), that must change to 000 for release. 67 \nFR 53182, 53233-53234 (Aug. 14, 2002)). \nUtilizing 2000 Census data, the following \nthree-digit ZCTAs have a population of \n20,000 or fewer persons. To produce a de-\nidentified data set utilizing the safe harbor \nmethod, all records with three-digit ZIP \ncodes corresponding to these three-digit \nZCTAs must have the ZIP code changed to \n000. Covered entities should not, however, \nrely upon this listing or the one found in the \nAugust 14, 2002 regulation if more current \ndata has been published. \n The 17 restricted ZIP codes are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department notes that these three-digit ZIP codes are based on the five-digit ZIP \nCode Tabulation Areas created by the Census Bureau for the 2000 Census. This new \nmethodology also is briefly described below, as it will likely be of interest to all users of \ndata tabulated by ZIP code. The Census Bureau will not be producing data files \ncontaining U.S. Postal Service ZIP codes either as part of the Census 2000 product \nseries or as a post Census 2000 product. However, due to the public‘s interest in having \nstatistics tabulated by ZIP code, the Census Bureau has created a new statistical area \ncalled the Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for Census 2000. The ZCTAs were \ndesigned to overcome the operational difficulties of creating a well-defined ZIP code \narea by using Census blocks (and the addresses found in them) as the basis for the \nZCTAs. In the past, there has been no correlation between ZIP codes and Census \nBureau geography. Zip codes can cross State, place, county, census tract, block group, \nand census block boundaries. The geographic designations the Census Bureau uses to \ntabulate data are relatively stable over time. For instance, census tracts are only defined \nevery ten years. In contrast, ZIP codes can change more frequently. Because of the ill-\ndefined nature of ZIP code boundaries, the Census Bureau has no file (crosswalk) \nshowing the relationship between US Census Bureau geography and U.S. Postal \nService ZIP codes. \nZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP code \nservice areas. Simply put, each one is built by aggregating the Census 2000 blocks, \nwhose addresses use a given ZIP code, into a ZCTA which gets that ZIP code assigned \nas its ZCTA code. They represent the majority USPS five-digit ZIP code found in a given \narea. For those areas where it is difficult to determine the prevailing five-digit ZIP code, \nthe higher-level three-digit ZIP code is used for the ZCTA code. For further information, \ngo to: http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/places2k.html. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nThe Bureau of the Census provides information regarding population density in the \nUnited States. Covered entities are expected to rely on the most current publicly \navailable Bureau of Census data regarding ZIP codes. This information can be \ndownloaded from, or queried at, the American Fact Finder website \n(http://factfinder.census.gov). As of the publication of this guidance, the information can \nbe extracted from the detailed tables of the ―Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF 1) 100-\nPercent Data‖ files under the ―Decennial Census‖ section of the website. The information \nis derived from the Decennial Census and was last updated in 2000. It is expected that \nthe Census Bureau will make data available from the 2010 Decennial Census in the near \nfuture. This guidance will be updated when the Census makes new information \navailable. \n3.2. May parts or derivatives of any of the listed identifiers be disclosed \nconsistent with the Safe Harbor Method? \nNo. For example, a data set that contained patient initials, or the last four digits of a \nSocial Security number, would not meet the requirement of the Safe Harbor method for \nde-identification. \n3.3. What are examples of dates that are not permitted according to the \nSafe Harbor Method? \nElements of dates that are not permitted for disclosure include the day, month, and any \nother information that is more specific than the year of an event. For instance, the date \n―January 1, 2009‖ could not be reported at this level of detail. However, it could be \nreported in a de-identified data set as ―2009‖. \nMany records contain dates of service or other events that imply age. Ages that are \nexplicitly stated, or implied, as over 89 years old must be recoded as 90 or above. For \nexample, if the patient‘s year of birth is 1910 and the year of healthcare service is \nreported as 2010, then in the de-identified data set the year of birth should be reported \nas ―on or before 1920.‖ Otherwise, a recipient of the data set would learn that the age of \nthe patient is approximately 100. \n3.4. Can dates associated with test measures for a patient be reported in \naccordance with Safe Harbor? \nNo. Dates associated with test measures, such as those derived from a laboratory \nreport, are directly related to a specific individual and relate to the provision of health \ncare. Such dates are protected health information. As a result, no element of a date \n(except as described in 3.3. above) may be reported to adhere to Safe Harbor. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \n3. 5. What constitutes “any other unique identifying number, characteristic, \nor code” with respect to the Safe Harbor method of the Privacy Rule? \nThis category corresponds to any unique features that are not explicitly enumerated in \nthe Safe Harbor list (A-Q), but could be used to identify a particular individual. Thus, a \ncovered entity must ensure that a data set stripped of the explicitly enumerated \nidentifiers also does not contain any of these unique features. The following are \nexamples of such features: \nIdentifying Number \nThere are many potential identifying numbers. For example, the preamble to the \nPrivacy Rule at 65 FR 82462, 82712 (Dec. 28, 2000) noted that ―Clinical trial \nrecord numbers are included in the general category of ‗any other unique \nidentifying number, characteristic, or code.‘ \nIdentifying Code \nA code corresponds to a value that is derived from a non-secure encoding \nmechanism. For instance, a code derived from a secure hash function without a \nsecret key (e.g., ―salt‖) would be considered an identifying element. This is \nbecause the resulting value would be susceptible to compromise by the recipient \nof such data. As another example, an increasing quantity of electronic medical \nrecord and electronic prescribing systems assign and embed barcodes into \npatient records and their medications. These barcodes are often designed to be \nunique for each patient, or event in a patient‘s record, and thus can be easily \napplied for tracking purposes. See the discussion of re-identification. \nIdentifying Characteristic \nA characteristic may be anything that distinguishes an individual and allows for \nidentification. For example, a unique identifying characteristic could be the \noccupation of a patient, if it was listed in a record as ―current President of State \nUniversity.‖ \nMany questions have been received regarding what constitutes ―any other unique \nidentifying number, characteristic or code‖ in the Safe Harbor approach,"

What is “actual knowledge” that the remaining information could be \nused either alone or in combination with other information to identify an \nindividual who is a subject of the information? \nIn the context of the Safe Harbor method, actual knowledge means clear and direct \nknowledge that the remaining information could be used, either alone or in combination \nwith other information, to identify an individual who is a subject of the information.

In addition, the covered entity was aware that \nthe data would provide sufficient context for the employee to recognize the \nrelative. For instance, the details of a complicated series of procedures, such as \na primary surgery followed by a set of follow-up surgeries and examinations, for a \nperson of a certain age and gender, might permit the recipient to comprehend \nthat the data pertains to his or her relative‘s case.

Therefore, the data would not have satisfied \nthe de-identification standard‘s Safe Harbor method. \nExample 4: Knowledge of a Recipient’s Ability \nImagine a covered entity was told that the anticipated recipient of the data has a \ntable or algorithm that can be used to identify the information, or a readily \navailable mechanism to determine a patient‘s identity. In this situation, the \ncovered entity has actual knowledge because it was informed outright that the \nrecipient can identify a patient, unless it subsequently received information \nconfirming that the recipient does not in fact have a means to identify a patient. \nTherefore, the data would not have satisfied the de-identification standard‘s Safe \nHarbor method. \n3.7. If a covered entity knows of specific studies about methods to re-\nidentify health information or use de-identified health information alone or \nin combination with other information to identify an individual, does this \nnecessarily mean a covered entity has actual knowledge under the Safe \nHarbor method? \nNo. Much has been written about the capabilities of researchers with certain analytic \nand quantitative capacities to combine information in particular ways to identify health \ninformation.32,33,34,35 A covered entity may be aware of studies about methods to identify \nremaining information or using de-identified information alone or in combination with \nother information to identify an individual. However, a covered entity‘s mere knowledge \nof these studies and methods, by itself, does not mean it has ―actual knowledge‖ that \nthese methods would be used with the data it is disclosing. OCR does not expect a \ncovered entity to presume such capacities of all potential recipients of de-identified data. \nThis would not be consistent with the intent of the Safe Harbor method, which was to \nprovide covered entities with a simple method to determine if the information is \nadequately de-identified. \n3. 8. Must a covered entity suppress all personal names, such as physician \nnames, from health information for it to be designated as de-identified? \nNo. Only names of the individuals associated with the corresponding health information \n(i.e., the subjects of the records) and of their relatives, employers, and household \nmembers must be suppressed. There is no explicit requirement to remove the names of \n32 K. El Emam, F. Dankar, R. Vaillancourt, T. Roffey, and M. Lysyk.

At the \nsame time, there is also no requirement to retain such information in a de-identified data \nset. \nBeyond the removal of names related to the patient, the covered entity would need to \nconsider whether additional personal names contained in the data should be suppressed \nto meet the actual knowledge specification. Additionally, other laws or confidentiality \nconcerns may support the suppression of this information. \n3.9. Must a covered entity use a data use agreement when sharing de-\nidentified data to satisfy the Safe Harbor Method? \nNo. The Privacy Rule does not limit how a covered entity may disclose information that \nhas been de-identified. However, nothing prevents a covered entity from asking a \nrecipient of de-identified information to enter into a data use agreement, such as is \nrequired for release of a limited data set under the Privacy Rule. This agreement may \nprohibit re-identification. Of course, the use of a data use agreement does not substitute \nfor any of the specific requirements of the Safe Harbor method. Further information \nabout data use agreements can be found on the OCR website.36 Covered entities may \nmake their own assessments whether such additional oversight is appropriate. \n3.10. Must a covered entity remove protected health information from free \ntext fields to satisfy the Safe Harbor Method? \nPHI may exist in different types of data in a multitude of forms and formats in a covered \nentity. This data may reside in highly structured database tables, such as billing records. \nYet, it may also be stored in a wide range of documents with less structure and written in \nnatural language, such as discharge summaries, progress notes, and laboratory test \ninterpretations. These documents may vary with respect to the consistency and the \nformat employed by the covered entity. \nThe de-identification standard makes no distinction between data entered into \nstandardized fields and information entered as free text (i.e., structured and unstructured \ntext) -- an identifier listed in the Safe Harbor standard must be removed regardless of its \nlocation in a record if it is recognizable as an identifier. \nWhether additional information must be removed falls under the actual knowledge \nprovision; the extent to which the covered entity has actual knowledge that residual \ninformation could be used to individually identify a patient. Clinical narratives in which a \nphysician documents the history and/or lifestyle of a patient are information rich and may \nprovide context that readily allows for patient identification. \nMedical records are comprised of a wide range of structured and unstructured (also \nknown as ―free text‖) documents. In structured documents, it is relatively clear which \nfields contain the identifiers that must be removed following the Safe Harbor method. \n36 Supra note 28. \n\n Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. \nFor instance, it is simple to discern when a feature is a name or a Social Security \nNumber, provided that the fields are appropriately labeled. However, many researchers \nhave observed that identifiers in medical information are not always clearly labeled.37.38 \nAs such, in some electronic health record systems it may be difficult to discern what a \nparticular term or phrase corresponds to (e.g., is 5/97 a date or a ratio?). It also is \nimportant to document when fields are derived from the Safe Harbor listed identifiers. \nFor instance, if a field corresponds to the first initials of names, then this derivation \nshould be noted. De-identification is more efficient and effective when data managers \nexplicitly document when a feature or value pertains to identifiers. Health Level 7 (HL7) \nand the International Standards Organization (ISO) publish best practices in \ndocumentation and standards that covered entities may consult in this process. \nExample Scenario 1 \nThe free text field of a patient‘s medical record notes that the patient is the \nExecutive Vice President of the state university.
